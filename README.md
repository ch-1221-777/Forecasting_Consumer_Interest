## Forecasting Consumer Interest in Eco-Friendly Products

In this project I use Google Trends and Facebook's Prophet model to analyze and forecast consumer interest in the following categories:

- Natural fabrics in Shopping > Apparel
- Non-toxic materials in Home & Garden > Kitchen & Dining
- Healthy descripions in Food & Drink

The Google Trends data spans the years 2010-2024 and we use it to forecast one year into the future. 

#### Natural Fabrics Trends

The following plot is the fitted time series for the above data which extends to the one-year horizon.
